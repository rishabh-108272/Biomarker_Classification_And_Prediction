# üß¨ Biomarker Identification for NSCLC using Multi-Omics and Explainable AI

## üîç Project Overview

A **biomarker** is a measurable indicator of a biological state or condition that provides vital insights into disease processes. Biomarkers play a critical role in clinical research, prognosis, diagnosis, and therapeutic development. With the advent of **multi-omics integration**, the discovery of biomarkers can be enhanced through a comprehensive view of complex biological systems and disease mechanisms.

This research project focuses on **Lung Cancer** and employs **multi-omics data** and **machine learning (ML)** with **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** techniques to uncover target biomarkers responsible for **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**. The outcome of this analysis can potentially assist researchers in identifying drug targets for personalized treatment.

## üìä Objectives

- Integrate and preprocess **multi-omics datasets** (RNA-Seq, methylation, CNA, protein arrays, and clinical data) from **TCGA-LUAD** and **TCGA-LUSC**.
- Develop ML models to classify NSCLC subtypes (LUAD and LUSC).
- Apply XAI methods (SHAP, LIME) to interpret model predictions and feature importance.
- Identify critical genes, hub proteins, and pathways through **PPI networks** and **KEGG pathway enrichment**.
- Build a survival prediction model using **Cox regression** and evaluate with Kaplan-Meier plots.

## üß™ Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Downloaded and assembled RNA-Seq, DNA-CNA, and protein array data from **TCGA**.
- Cleaned, normalized, and integrated the datasets for downstream analysis.

### 2. **Modeling and Classification**
- Trained **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** and **Logistic Regression** models on RNA-Seq and DNA+CNA data.
- Classified tumor samples into LUAD and LUSC subtypes.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### 3. **Model Explainability with XAI**
- Implemented **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** and **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** to understand key biomarkers influencing the predictions.
- Interpreted gene features related to:
  - Tumor microenvironment
  - Cell cycle regulation
  - Immune system modulation

### 4. **Biological Analysis**
- Conducted **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)** network analysis to identify **hub proteins**.
- Applied **KEGG pathway enrichment** to uncover significant biological pathways.
- Filtered top differentially expressed genes/proteins for potential therapeutic targets.

### 5. **Survival Prediction**
- Developed **Cox Proportional Hazards Regression** models for survival analysis.
- Used **Kaplan-Meier curves** and **Kernel Density Estimations (KDE)** to visualize survival probability by subtype.
- Assessed risk stratification of patients based on biomarker expression.
